![Self portrait][1]

I am a full-time healthcare data analyst and a freelance computational  artist. I use my background  in  epidemiology  and  data  science to  enable  and  support  research regarding cancer survivorship. 

Using primarily the R programming language, I create data art and generative art systems. I also co-lead an online community where we hype up the recreation of art as a practice of improving coding skills.
