    I am a full-time healthcare data analyst. I use my background  in  epidemiology and  data  science to  enable  and  support  research regarding cancer survivorship. I am also a freelance computational artist. Using code (mainly the R programming language), I create data art and generative art systems.

    My art is focused on creating playful, colorful, geometric patterns by manipulating basic shapes and various grid layouts. I co-lead an <a href = "https://github.com/sharlagelfand/RecreationThursday">online community</a> where we hype up the recreation of art as a practice of improving coding skills. I sometimes share code and create write-ups discussing my process for art. You can see them on my <a href ="https://github.com/Ijeamakaanyene?tab=repositories">Github</a> or on my <a href="https://ijeamaka-anyene.netlify.app/blog.html">blog</a>.
