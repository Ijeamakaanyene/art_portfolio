![Self portrait][1]

I am a full-time healthcare data analyst. I use my background  in  epidemiology and  data  science to  enable  and  support  research regarding cancer survivorship. 

I am also a freelance computational artist. Using code (mainly the R programming language), I create data art and generative art systems. My art is focused mainly on creating playful, colorful, geometric patterns by manipulating basic shapes and various grid layouts. I also co-lead an [online community](https://github.com/sharlagelfand/RecreationThursday) where we hype up the recreation of art as a practice of improving coding skills.

I often do not share code that lead to final pieces, but I sometimes create write-ups and blurbs discussing what led to the final process. You can see them on my [Github](https://github.com/Ijeamakaanyene?tab=repositories) or on my [blog](https://ijeamaka-anyene.netlify.app/blog.html).

I am available for commissions and collaborations.
