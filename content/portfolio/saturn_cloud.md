Generative icons for Saturn Cloud, 2022.

<!--more-->

In Spring 2022, I was contracted by Saturn Cloud to create generative profile icons for their users. To do so, I created a generative art system inspired by Github's [Identicons](https://github.blog/2013-08-14-identicons/).  

Using R, my approach started with two basic layouts and then by incorporating a simplified version of subdivision, multiple layers of shapes, and bright colors, various lively profile pictures emerged. The sole thing that controls the end user icon is the user's username that gets converted into a hash. 

More details regarding the project can be found the [Saturn Cloud blog account](https://saturncloud.io/blog/default-icons/) which was also cross-posted to my blog.
