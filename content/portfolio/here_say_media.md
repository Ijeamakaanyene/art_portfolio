Here Say Media in 2021, *data visualization*. 
<!--more-->

In 2021, I did data visualization contract work for San Francisco Standard (formerly Here Say Media). In collaboration with the team, I did data curation, analysis and visualization for a piece [Vaccine Rollout in San Francisco Neighborhoods](https://sfstandard.com/public-health-safety/chinatown-vaccine-rollout-lagging-rest-of-san-francisco/).
